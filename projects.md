## miner project ideas

- The
  [Learn to program with Minecraft](https://www.nostarch.com/programwithminecraft/)
  book teach the basic of Python programming (variables, arithmetic, loops,
  conditionals, functions, etc.) with minecraft. We could do all of that with R.

- Drawing shapes: square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, cube, sphere, knot

- Make a pyramid

- Make an impenetrable castle with bedrock

- Recreate Stone Henge

- Drop a block along the path you've taken (as in
  [this tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/worksheet/))

- Drop a block along the path you've taken, but only on top of a
  certain kind of block (e.g., placing flowers, but only on grass or
  dirt) (again, from
  [this tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/worksheet/).)

- Be Midas: every block you step on turns to gold

- Be Elsa: when you step on water, it turns to ice

- Make a contour plot of a mountain: use `getHeight` to determine
  height and then plot that in R

- Make a gray-scale version of an image with different shades of
  blocks, making use of the
  [imager package](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/).

- Make a color image, but you'd first need to work out the colors of
  different blocks (using
  [this image file](http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/images/sprites/items-26.png))
  and then figure out how to do color matching.

- Whac-a-mole game, as in
  [this tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/minecraft-whac-a-block-game/worksheet/)

- Make a 3d scatterplot, for example of the `iris` data, as
  [here](http://smarterpoland.pl/index.php/2016/09/minecharts-1-minecraft-r-edgar-andersons-iris-data/).

- Make a bouncing ball

- Plot the coordinates of the "carbon backbone" in a protein, using
  data from the
  [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). For
  example, look at the
  [structure for the protein myoglobin](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1MBN),
  the first protein whose three-dimesional structure was determined.
  The PDB data file format is
  [described here](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html).
