## miner project ideas

- Drawing shapes: square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, cube, sphere, knot

- Drop a block along the path you've taken

- Drop a block along the path you've taken, but only on top of a
  certain kind of block (e.g., placing flowers, but only on grass or
  dirt)

- Make a contour plot of a mountain: use `getHeight` to determine
  height and then plot that in R

- Make a gray-scale version of an image with different shades of
  blocks, making use of the
  [imager package](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/).

- Make a color image, but you'd first need to work out the colors of
  different blocks (using
  [this image file](http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/images/sprites/items-26.png))
  and then figure out how to do color matching.
